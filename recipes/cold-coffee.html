    <p>Icy cold coffee is simply the best beverage to enjoy on a hot summer day. Even though I tend to be more of a tea drinker, I do love a good cup of coffee occasionally – and this cafe-style blended coffee drink is my favorite!

        Similar to what you find at nearly every local coffee shop, this shake-like cold coffee recipe is made with sugar and milk blended together with ice. It creates a refreshing and rich beverage, with a delightfully frothy layer on top.
        
        The taste is like a lighter Frappuccino or Frappe – but you can add flavored syrups to recreate nearly any blended iced coffee flavors.
        
        I have used instant coffee powder to make this a quick and easy recipe. You could use either the powdered or granular instant coffee.</p>

        <h2>How to Make Cold Coffee</h2>
        <ol>
            <h2>Make Coffee Mixture</h2>
            <li>Firstly, add 1 tablespoon of instant coffee to a bowl. 
                If using brewed filter coffee or espresso you can add ¼ cup directly to the blender jar as shown in step 3 below.</li>
                <li>Add ¼ cup of warm water (not hot) to the instant coffee. Stir and mix very well.</li>

                <h2> Blend Coffee Concoction</h2>
                <li>Add the coffee solution to a blender jar.</li>
                <li>Next add 3 to 4 tablespoons of sugar.</li>
                <li>Blend for a minute or until the coffee solution becomes frothy and the color fades to a lighter shade of brown.</li>

                <h2> Make Iced Coffee</h2>
                <li> Add 6 or 7 ice cubes. For a thicker blended cold coffee use just 2 to 4 cubes of ice.</li>
                <li>Then pour in 2 cups of cold or chilled milk. To make this recipe, I used whole milk. See FAQs below for low fat cold coffee tips.</li>
                <li>Pour into tall glasses and serve cold coffee immediately. The frothy top layer will settle into the beverage as it sits, so it’s best to enjoy blended iced coffee right away.</li>
