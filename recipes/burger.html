    <p>A chicken burger the whole family enjoys! Natasha is my eldest daughter, and her eyes light up when I announce we're having these for dinner. 
        The onion can be finely chopped, but with three kids, we prefer grating it so as to hide it. 
        I usually serve these with mashed potatoes and Caesar salad for a very comforting meal!</p>

        <h2>Ingredients</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>1 pound extra-lean ground chicken</li>
